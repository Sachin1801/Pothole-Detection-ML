# Pothole Detection with YOLOv2 on Raspberry Pi

## Overview

Pothole Detection with YOLOv2 on Raspberry Pi is a Machine Learning project aimed at automatically detecting potholes on roads. The project uses the YOLOv2 algorithm to perform real-time object detection and identifies potholes in the video feed. The integration of the model into Raspberry Pi 4 startup scripts ensures that the system is ready for deployment and can be used as a standalone pothole detection solution.

## Features

- Real-time Pothole Detection: Utilizing the YOLOv2 algorithm, the system can efficiently detect potholes in real-time from a live video stream.

- Raspberry Pi 4 Integration: The model is integrated into Raspberry Pi 4 startup scripts, making the deployment process seamless and ready for usage on the Raspberry Pi.

- User-friendly Interface: The project comes with a user-friendly interface that displays the live video feed along with pothole detection bounding boxes.


### Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4
- Python 3
- OpenCV
- YOLOv2 model weights and configuration files
- Sample video or webcam feed for testing
